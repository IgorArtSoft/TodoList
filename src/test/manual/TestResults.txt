I've run POST twice using curl command.

Then I've issued read all todos
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Buy salt",
    "completionStatus": "Process Initiated"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "Buy Sugar",
    "completionStatus": "Purchased"
  }
]

I called UPDATE via curl. 
It changed a values of 1st
